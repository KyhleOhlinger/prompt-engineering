Random assortment of prompts that I have been testing out and scripts to run them with different AI models.

## How to Use the Bots
- **Python Scripts:** The Python scripts can be used to interact with the different AI models and use the personas (prompts/bots) for one-shot prompting.
- **System Styles:**  My preferred way is to use these prompts/bots as System prompts when creating GPTs. You can do this by creating additional Python scripts or simply inserting them into available models such as ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc. and interacting with the models as you normally would.
